              The goal of this project is to create a centralized platform that
              aggregates animal data from multiple animal shelters&apos;
              websites, facilitating the search for dogs and cats for potential
              local pet owners. The project aims to provide a user-friendly
              interface where users can easily find and adopt pets in their
              local area.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Scraping and Data Processing:</strong> The back-end of
                the site is responsible for scraping animal data from various
                animal shelters&apos; websites using Cheerio. It processes,
                filters, and organizes the data, ensuring it is ready for
                display on the front-end.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Centralized Database:</strong> The scraped animal data
                is stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose for efficient and
                schema-based data modeling.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> The front-end, built
                with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Bootstrap 5, provides an
                intuitive user interface where potential pet owners can easily
                search for dogs and cats based on different criteria such as
                breed, age, and gender.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Type Safety:</strong> TypeScript brings static typing to
                the development process, enhancing code quality and providing
                early detection of potential errors. It improves maintainability
                and collaboration in larger codebases.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Developer Tooling:</strong> TypeScript offers features
                like autocompletion, intelligent code navigation, and
                refactoring tools, improving developer productivity and reducing
                debugging time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved Error Handling:</strong> TypeScript catches
                common errors during the development phase, reducing runtime
                errors and providing more robust error handling in the
                application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> PurgeCSS is employed
                to remove unused CSS from the project, reducing the CSS build
                files{"'"} size and improving loading times.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>API Endpoints:</strong> The back-end server provides an
                API for data consumption. It exposes several endpoints that
                allow users to retrieve specific data and customize their search
                options. Detailed documentation regarding data fetching from
                these API endpoints can be found in the &quot;API&quot; section
                on the live site:{" "}

                .
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CI/CD Strategy:</strong> The project follows a
                continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
                strategy, ensuring that changes are thoroughly tested and
                deployed efficiently.
